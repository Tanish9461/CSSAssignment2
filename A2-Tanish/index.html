        <section class="l1">         
            <p> I found a  <strong>LOVE</strong> for me</p>
            <p> Oh, darlin', just dive right in and follow my lead</p>
            <p>Well, I found a girl <strong>BEAUTIFUL</strong>  and <strong>SWEET</strong></p>
            <p>Oh, I never knew you were the someone waitin' for me</p>
        </section> 
       <p>[Pre-Chorus]</p>
       <p>'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love</p>
       <p>Not knowin' what it was</p>
       <p>I will not give you up this time</p>
       <p>But, darlin', just kiss me slow</p>
       <p>Your <strong> heart</strong> is all I own</p>
       <p>And in your eyes, you're holdin' mine</p>
        <section class="l1">
            <p>[Chorus]</p>
            <p>Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms</p>
            <p>Barefoot on the <span> Grass</span>  while listenin' to our favourite song</p>
            <p>When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath</p>
            <strong>But you heard it, darlin', you look perfect tonight</strong>
        </section>
       <p>[Verse 2]</p>
       <p>Well, I found a woman stronger than anyone I know</p>
       <p>She shares my <span class="d1">dreams</span>, I hope that, someday, I'll share her  <span class="d1">hope</span></p>
       <p>I found a love to carry more than just my secrets</p>
       <strong>To carry love, to carry children of our own</strong>
    
       <section class="l1">
            <p>[Pre-Chorus]</p>
            <p>We are still kids, but we're so in   <strong>LOVE</strong></p>
            <p>Fightin' against all odds</p>
            <p>I know we'll be alright this time</p>
            <strong>Darlin', just hold my hand</strong>
            <p>Be my girl, I'll be your man</p>
            <span class="d1"> I see my future in your eyes</span>
        

            <p>[Chorus]</p>
            <p>Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms</p>
            <p>Barefoot on the <span> Grass</span>  while listenin' to our favourite song</p>
            <p>When I saw you in that dress, lookin' so beautiful</p>
            <p>I don't deserve this, darlin', you look perfect tonight</p>

            <p>We're barefoot on the  <span> Grass</span> , oh, listenin' to our favourite song</p>
            <p>I have faith in what I see, now I know I have met</p>
            <span class="d1">An angel in person and she looks perfect</span>
